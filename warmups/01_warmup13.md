# Warmup

## Instructions

1. In your starter project, open the files in the `w1d3` directory. 
2. Find a partner (preferably one that you have not yet worked with), and work
   through the following exercises as a pair.

## Exercises

1. Fix the syntax and/or style issues with the following functions:

   ```js
   function isHot(temperature) {
     if temperature>90 {
     return "It's hot!";
     return "It's not hot!";
   }

   function oldEnoughTo(age) {
     if age >= 16
     return "Drive a car";
     } if else (age >= 17); {
            return "Vote";
     else (age => 21) {
   return "Drink";
     }
     else {
     return "Do all the things!";
     }
   }
   ```

2. Write a function `sayHello` that takes a *language* parameter, and returns
   "hello" in that language. Make the function work with **at least three
   languages**.

3. Write a function `validCredentials` that accepts two parameters: *username*
   and *password*, and returns `true` if **both** are long enough, and `false`
   otherwise. You can decide what constitutes "long enough".
