# Warmup - Fundamentals

## Exercises

1. What are at least two different types of data (values) you know?

2. Write an expression in the console to evaluate the percentage of people in
   class who are wearing glasses today.

3. What's wrong with this function (there are multiple problems)?

   ```js
   function cube x {
   return x * x * y;
   ```

   Fix it so that it computes the cube of x.

4. The polynomial identities state that the following two equations are
   equivalent:

   $${(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2}$$

   Write two functions called `lhs` and `rhs` (for left-hand side and right-hand
   side) to compute each half of the above equation. Do they produce the same
   result when invoked with the same arguments?
